# Web Scraper and CVE Dashboard

## Overview

SentientWebscraper is a tool designed by [Jordan](https://github.com/itisnotjord/) to scrape cybersecurity news from multiple sources and perform sentiment analysis using a Huggingface AI model. This project leverages `beautifulsoup4`, `huggingface transformers` and `streamlit`.

CVE Dashboard combines information from various sources to provide an overview of reported vulnerabilities and combines data from NVD and FIRST. It also serves as an offline copy of the NVD, allowing users to view information about a CVE without an internet connection after retrieval from NVD. It also attempts to predict monthly CVE trends for the next 6 months using a SARIMAX model based on [this article](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/01/19/predicting-monthly-cve-disclosure-trends-for-2024-a-time-series-sarimax-approach).

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Currently supports scraping from:
  - [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)
  - [Cybersecurity News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes [ProsusAI/finbert](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) for analyzing the sentiment of the news articles.
- **Customization:** Easily add new scraping sources by modifying `CollatingNews.py`.
- **CVE Statistics:** Show statistics of CVEs from the current year and the most recently analysed vulnerabilities
- **CVE Details:** After the database has been downloaded, this serves as a local cache of the CVE database scraped by NVD, and includes the EPSS score and its 30-day history. The CVE details and EPSS score are checked and updated every 12 hours, if there are new releases by FIRST and NVD.
- **CVE Prediction:** Based on data from the past 5 years, it aims to provide a rough estimate of the CVE reports for the next 6 months.  This model is automatically updated every month

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
  
### Build and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file
2. Start with Docker Compose
    ```
    docker compose up
    ```
3. On first start, it may take about 15-20 mins to download the data. After which, the site can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000`

## Information about CVE Dashboard
There will be changes made to this, mainly focusing on code readability and quality as admittedly, the current code was focused more on making it work and it currently conforms to neither any code quality or coding standards.

There may also be some changes to features made in the next month or so.
